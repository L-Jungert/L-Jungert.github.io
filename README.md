# L-Jungert.github.io

## hello-world
This is a practice repository for github flow purposes

My name is Logan Jungert, a Computer Systems engineering major at BSU. I love mountain biking and skiing!


### This is a copy from the initial project
Therefore, I did do the push and delete step, however it won't be in this project because I made a new repo.
